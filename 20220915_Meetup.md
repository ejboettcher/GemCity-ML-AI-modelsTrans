## Introduction

I am, Evelyn Boettcher, and I am a physicist and have been doing machine learning on and off again before Tensorflow has been around.  There was not a ML/AI or even a data science /visualization around Dayton and I thought that needed to change so I asked Allen if I could host a ML/AI group under Gem City Tech.

Allen May is the main Gem City Tech leader. The go to guy for all things web related.


Gem City Tech is a family of user groups bringing tech-focused content to the Dayton Ohio community. Their calendar is filled with opportunities to learn and share information 'about all things tech'.

## ML Ethics: a challenging problem

Our lives are increasingly becoming more involved with ML algorithms.  From health diagnosis, fraud detection to tracking customers in stores. 

What happens when you get miss Identified in an Algorithm? 

This is cautionary tale of when AI gets a wrong identification (https://lnkd.in/e5neHt8E). He lost his digital life because he was accused by Google of transmitting explicate child imagery, because his son's doctor told him to send a picture of the rash on a private part during Covid.  Google terminated phone and email services.

Discussion ideals:

* Did this corrupt the database of known bad images
   * Will this cause more false positives?
* Can Google just take your digital paper's with out returning them if you break the term's of service
* Is it OK if have your private photos be viewed by people without your knowledge if AI finds them interesting.
* What about the child. 
  * How are future algorithms going to use his image? Will he be targeted for high risk of developing depression since he is in this pedro database now?  Can insurance companies charge him more for insurance now or in the future?
  * Shouldn't the child have a right to how his image is being used?  Does this violate the child's privacy?

* Who has final say if photos are bad: You, police or Google?  Should it just be one person/group or several groups.
* What about hospital systems: 
   * Will AI start flagging medical images as bad.  Will doctors move away from tele medicine so as not to risk being accused of a miss deed?

### Other instances of Algorithms "bad"

[The algorithms that detect hate speech online are biased against black people](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/15/20806384/social-media-hate-speech-bias-black-african-american-facebook-twitter) 1.5x more likely to flag tweets written by African Americans as "offensive"


[Facing Bias in Facial Recognition Technology](https://www.theregreview.org/2021/03/20/saturday-seminar-facing-bias-in-facial-recognition-technology/)
* Example: Police falsely arrested Williams after facial recognition technology matched him to the image of a suspect

[Algorithmic Bias in Health Care Exacerbates Social Inequities â€” How to Prevent It](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ecpe/how-to-prevent-algorithmic-bias-in-health-care/)Simple prediction rules for heart disease, which were used in routine medical practice in industrialized countries for decades, were biased. The Framingham Heart Study cardiovascular risk score performed very well for Caucasian but not African American patients, which means that care could be unequally distributed and inaccurate. 


### The Good and the Bad

The good news is that it is well known and talked about that algorithms can be biased and something needs to be done.

But companies have fired AI Ethicist for speaking out for the last couple of years. [Google Fires AI Researchers](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/02/technology/google-fires-ai-researchers.html)

## Introduction

I am, Evelyn Boettcher, and I am a physicist and have been doing machine learning on and off again before Tensorflow has been around.  There was not a ML/AI or even a data science /visualization around Dayton and I thought that needed to change so I asked Allen if I could host a ML/AI group under Gem City Tech.

Allen May is the main Gem City Tech leader. The go to guy for all things web related.


Gem City Tech is a family of user groups bringing tech-focused content to the Dayton Ohio community. Their calendar is filled with opportunities to learn and share information 'about all things tech'.

## ML Ethics: a challenging problem
Our lives are increasingly becoming more involved with ML algorithms.  From health diagnosis, fraud detection to tracking customers in stores. 

What happens when you get miss Identified in an Algorithm? 

This is cautionary tale of when AI gets a wrong identification (https://lnkd.in/e5neHt8E)
